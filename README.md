Movie Ticket Booking System
This code represents a simple movie ticket booking system that allows users to view movie details and purchase tickets. The system displays a list of available movies and their details, including the film title, runtime, showtime, and the number of available tickets. Users can click on a movie to view its details and purchase tickets if they are available.

Features
•	Load First Movie: The system loads the details of the first movie from the server and displays its information, including the film title, runtime, showtime, and the number of available tickets.
•	Load All Movies: The system fetches a list of all available movies from the server and displays their titles. Users can click on a movie title to view its details.
•	Movie Click Event: When a user clicks on a movie title, the system fetches the details of that specific movie from the server and displays its information, including the film title, runtime, showtime, and the number of available tickets.
•	Purchase Ticket: Users can attempt to purchase a ticket for the selected movie. If tickets are available, the system displays the number of remaining tickets after the purchase. If no more tickets are available, an alert message informs the user that no more tickets are available.
